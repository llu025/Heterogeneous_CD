# Heterogeneous_CD
This repository contains the software developed for the project of Heterogeneous Change Detection in Remote Sensing Images.

## Available data

Two datasets were mainly used for this project.
The Texas dataset can be found at Michele Volpi's [webpage](https://zenodo.org/record/8046719) and it is associated with [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2015.02.005). Please cite!

The California dataset was created for this project, it can be found at [this link](https://sites.google.com/view/luppino/data). Please cite my work [Unsupervised Image Regression for Heterogeneous Change Detection](https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2019.2930348)!
